HI!
It happens that I'm reading more than ever. I can read everything, well, not everything, but I won't disclose it, not yet. 
Lately, I've been reading books that can help me grow in my career as an engineering manager. 
First, my idea is to collect the notes, so later, I can curate them in a way that I can refer to easily and quickly. 

Kindle is hard... 



This is a work in progress. First book to go in is Empowered, M. Cagan
